**Webapp requires Mac or Linux OS**

**How to start up the ecseg webapp:**

0. Clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/nbavafa/CSE182.git```.
1. If you just cloned the repository, enter the frontend folder and run ```npm install``` (this step is not necessary if you have already launched the webapp before)
2. To start the frontend, run ```npm start``` while still in the frontend folder.
3. Enter the backend folder and run ```python3 ecseg_flask.py``` to start the backend. 
4. You're done! The webapp should be hosted at localhost:3000
